          Picture this: you're at a wild party, the dance floor's packed and the
          energy's off the charts. Suddenly, the music drops out. Half the
          crowd's gone. Then more leave. And more. Until it's just you, swaying
          awkwardly all alone. Sounds pretty dreadful, right? Well, that's kind
          of what's happening to our planet -- we're losing species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans trying to save endangered species is like running a marathon
          where the finish line keeps moving further away. We're running, we're
          sweating, we're putting in the effort, but no matter how hard we try,
          it never seems enough to get us across the line. The dual threats of
          overexploitation and climatic upheaval aren't just moving the
          goalposts but turning the whole field into quicksand.

                The verdant heart of Central Africa, Gabon, is home to a unique
                dweller –- the African forest elephant. In 2021, the reality of
                this majestic creature's plight was revealed through a solemn
                expedition by dedicated researchers. The revelations were stark
                - the population had dwindled to approximately 95,000. Over the
                span of 31 years, a devastating decline of over 86% had
                occurred. Classified as critically endangered by the IUCN in the

                types, grapples with survival in their ever-constricting forest
                homes.

              <p>
                The primary threats to these elephants stem from rampant
                poaching, driven by the demand for bushmeat and the insidious
                global ivory trade. Thousands of these grand creatures are
                killed every year to feed this illegal demand. The magnitude of
                this tragedy was gruesomely illustrated in January 2012, when a
                horde of Sudanese poachers massacred over 200 elephants in a
                solitary national park in Cameroon.

              </h2>
              <p>
                The Amur leopard, known as the world's rarest big cat, was first
                classified as critically endangered by IUCN back in 1960. This
                leopard subspecies, one among the eight that inhabit the
                terrains of Africa and Asia, has been teetering on the brink of
                extinction for decades. In 2007, estimates suggested as few as
                19 to 26 wild leopards left. By 2015, the count barely crossed
                60 in both Russia and China.

                  However, recent reports from 2021 indicate a potential turning
                  point. Current estimates put the wild Amur leopard population
                  at around 110. These numbers represent not just a glimmer of
                  hope, but the fruit of concerted conservation efforts.

                <p>
                  Let’s go behind the numbers and swing back to 1999. Back then,
                  the Russian government had approved a plan for the protection
                  of the Amur leopard. Furthermore, Russian President Vladimir
                  Putin, in power since 2000, showed his commitment to the
                  preservation of this species by signing an order in 2012. This
                  order expanded the leopard's protected habitat and led to the
                  establishment of the 269,000-hectare "Land of the Leopard ''
                  national park.

              </p>
              <p>
                Previous years' study pointed out that fewer than 4,000 of these
                remarkable creatures are estimated to inhabit the wild, but the
                story is evolving. Fortunately, a revised density estimate now
                puts the population at around 6,800 - a flicker of hope, yet far
                from a sigh of relief.

              <p>
                Over the span of a single generation, from 1995 to 2016, the
                population of these gorillas plunged by a staggering 58%,
                dwindling at an annual rate of 4.0%. To put it in perspective,
                the current population of 5,252 is just 42% of the 1995-1996
                estimate of 12,390 for the same area. The drastic decline led to
                the classification of the Grauer's gorilla as Critically
                Endangered in 2016.

                What's equally striking is our biological kinship with these
                animals. Human share around 98% of our DNA with gorillas,
                marking them as our closest relatives after chimpanzees and
                bonobos. This close genetic link, however, leaves them
                vulnerable to human diseases, even common colds, as they haven't
                developed necessary immunities or any medical protection. Their
                diet, mainly composed of stems, bamboo shoots, and fruits, is
                indicative of their gentle, non-aggressive nature.

                However, they face an array of threats, primarily stemming from

                In a poignant incident in 2007, an entire family of mountain
                gorillas was slaughtered by locals, a political act aimed at
                forcing the park open for resource exploitation.

                Even tourism, despite its benefits in bring up economy status

                to survival. With just 76 individuals remaining on our planets,
                they are the most endangered among all rhino species. Once
                thriving across the lush landscapes of northeast India and
                Southeast Asia, their range has been decimated, leaving only
                this small enclave as their last stronghold.
              </p>
              <p>
                This extraordinary species, the Javan rhino, is confined to a
                single protected area, making their survival all the more
                precarious. Their biology remains shrouded in mystery, as
                scientists have struggled to gain comprehensive knowledge about
                their behaviors and needs. The dense jungles they inhabit have
                hindered detailed observation, and the species has never
                successfully bred in captivity, further exacerbating their

                Recent years have brought fresh challenges to the dwindling
                Javan rhino population. Disease has emerged as a deadly threat,
                claiming the lives of these rare rhinos. The root of the disease
                can be traced back to wild cattle in the park, underscoring the
                complex web of interactions within the ecosystem and the grave
                consequences they can have for these magnificent creatures.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sadly, the last hope for wild Javan rhinos outside Ujung Kulon
                National Park vanished in 2010. A rhino in Cat Tien National
                Park, Vietnam, fell victim to poaching, its horn savagely
                removed. This cruel act sealed the fate of the species in

              <p>
                Black rhinos, adorned with their distinctive gray coats, possess
                two magnificent horns, with the foremost horn prominently longer
                than the other. Their adaptability is noteworthy, as they can
                thrive in a wide array of habitats, ranging from arid deserts in
                Namibia to verdant woodlands offering respite and sustenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once roaming throughout the vast landscapes of sub-Saharan
                Africa, the black rhino population witnessed a remarkable heyday
                in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thriving with an estimated
                count of up to 850,000 individuals. However, the passage of time
                brought profound challenges, and by 1970, their numbers had
                dwindled to a mere 65,000, scattered across isolated pockets of
                their once abundant habitat.

                Large-scale poaching activities fueled by the illegal
                international trade in rhino horn became a menacing force,

              <p>
                By 1995, their situation had reached a critical point, with a
                devastating decline of 98% since 1960, leaving only 2,410
                individuals remaining. The relentless demand for rhino horn,
                highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine and for ornamental
